# Implementing Structured Logging using SeriLog in ASP.NET Core 7.0 Web API

Serilog is a popular structured logging library for .NET applications. It's easy to set up, feature-rich, and supports a wide variety of "sinks" - outputs where your logs can be sent.

## Serilog Sinks

A sink in Serilog is a destination where your log events are sent. There are sinks for various outputs like the console, files, databases, and even other logging platforms like Seq

For more information about each sink and how to use them, please refer to the official documentation of the relevant nuget package.
